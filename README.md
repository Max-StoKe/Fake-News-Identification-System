# Fake-News-Identification-System
This Python-based system is designed to crawl, store, and analyze fake news reports from the Taiwan FactCheck Center website.  The collected data is able to save into both CSV files and an SQL database, allowing users to browse and review all stored information directly within the system.

project_v2 is the current working version (due to HTML structure changes from the Taiwan FactCheckCenter).

The code is currently in Traditional Chinese but English will be added later.

and may have more features.
